# Dynamic programming notes
Dynamic programming is an important topic in basic algorithms. It solves problems by combining the solutions to sub-problems. DP applies when the subproblems overlap - that is , when subproblems share sub-subproblems.

When developing DP, we basically follow a sequence of four steps:

 - Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
 - Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
 - Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion
 - Construct an optimal solution from computed information
 
 The key of DP is to find the structure of optimal solution.
